Handwritten Document Recognition implemented using [TensorFlow 2.1.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and trained on the IAM dataset. For, each document in the IAM dataset, this Neural Network model recognizes the text contained in the images of segmented texts lines and combine each of the lines in order to recognize complete text. 


## Dataset


- [IAM](http://www.fki.inf.unibe.ch/databases/iam-handwriting-database)

- Dataset is partitioned into train, test and validation following the guidelines given with the dataset.




## Train and test (Google Colab/Drive)

Run the following notebook **(https://github.com/aastha-m8/Handwritten-document-recognition/blob/master/src/main.ipynb)** on Google Colab/Drive.
